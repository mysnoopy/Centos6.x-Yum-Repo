# Centos6.x-Yum-Repo
Centos6.x Yum Repo

Centos 6 and its yum repo were EOL and no longer supported by the community, which means that the default yum install/update will give out an error because the official repo and mirror repo sites are unavailable. 

The Centos6.10-base.repo and epel.repo here provides the last repo archive for Centos6.x. The yum install and yum update is working as expected when I created the files. I tested with Centos 6.5, and everything works as intended. You can get the complete Centos 6.5 with a working yum repo from [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mysnoopy/centos6.5).
